    <p>Hi, I'm Andy — an outdoor enthusiast, former real estate professional, and current ski patroller and raft guide.   
    I grew up in Grafton, Ohio, a small, rural town where the great outdoors was my playground. My childhood was filled with adventure, from endless days spent playing sports to exploring the natural beauty of my surroundings. I was drawn to sports, and ice hockey quickly became my passion, shaping my character and teaching me invaluable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and resilience.
    </p>
    <p>Today, I’m fortunate to live a life that revolves around my love for nature. In the winter, I work as a ski patroller at Canyons Park City, where I get to combine my love for the mountains with the responsibility of ensuring the safety of skiers. In the summer, I work as a raft guide on the New and Gauley Rivers in West Virginia, where the thrill of whitewater rafting keeps me energized and constantly challenged.   
    But my path to this outdoor lifestyle wasn’t always so clear-cut. After initially pursuing a degree in turfgrass science and briefly working in real estate, I realized that my schedule didn’t align with the lifestyle I wanted. I was craving something more dynamic, something that connected me to nature. That’s when I made a life-changing decision: I took a winter off during the pandemic to ski patrol out West, and what started as a temporary escape soon turned into a passion that reshaped my entire career.
    </p>
    <p>    Throughout my journey, one thing has always remained central to everything I do: the belief that we should treat others the way we want to be treated. It’s a principle that guides my professional relationships as much as it does my personal ones.   
    I also believe that in today’s digital age, people spend too much time indoors, disconnected from the natural world. Nature has a profound healing power, and it’s something I try to share with everyone I meet, whether they’re skiing the slopes or navigating the rapids. Spending time outside not only restores the mind but also connects us to a deeper sense of purpose and happiness.
    </p>   
    <p>In the winter, I work as a ski patroller at Canyons Park City, where I ensure the safety of skiers, assist with emergency situations, and help maintain the slopes so everyone can enjoy the thrill of the mountains.

    <p>During the summer months, I guide rafters through the New and Gauley Rivers in West Virginia, offering a thrilling experience through some of the most scenic and challenging rapids in the country. It’s a job that requires quick thinking, teamwork, and a deep respect for the power of nature.

    <p>    At the heart of my life and work is a simple message: Get outside and be happy. The outdoors has a unique way of grounding us, offering peace, excitement, and healing all at once. Whether you’re skiing on fresh powder or rafting through wild rivers, there’s something about nature that restores the soul. It’s an experience I encourage everyone to embrace, even if just for a day.
